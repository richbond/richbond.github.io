## Online Store Manager Blog

When I had to create an online store manager, the first thing I had to do was think of a mapping structure where I determine how everything connects.  I had to think of the lists, dictionaries, counters, and classes that I needed to create.  Since this is one of my first coding projects, there was quite a bit of trial and error.  I build this up line by line, testing each line as I went along to make sure it works properly.  Since I ran my family business for 7 years, I was able to undertand how everything should link up and what errors i need to check for.  By assiging unique id's to customers and purchases, I was able to ensure no duplicate entries. There were several ways I could've created each object.  I ended up choosing things that were simple, clean to code, and it had to return the information I needed.  One thing I focused on was collecting the data I needed in a way so I can report on it later.

Since I never coded with objects before, it was a tedious process to get it working properly.  I build it up the first time in such a way, that when I got to the end, I couldn't get some of the functionality working properly.  So I had to tear it down and start again.  Fortunately for me, I had classmates and teachers who were very helpful.  Once I had the code working properly, I had to create instances so my clients can purchase predefined templates.  Now that it works, and I learn more, I can revisit this project later and improve on it.
